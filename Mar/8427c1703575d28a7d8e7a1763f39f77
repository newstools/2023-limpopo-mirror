Nduvho Madzivhandila, an honours student at the University of Venda (Univen), is still bursting with pride after representing South Africa at this year’s Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain, held at the Fira de Barcelona Gran Via between 27 February and 2 March. Nduvho (27), a resident at Lwamondo, was among 45 young individuals from 30 different countries, including Germany, Uganda and Colombia, who attended the annual trade show. The event, organised by GSMA, is dedicated primarily to the mobile communications industry. During his final year in BCom business information systems last year, Nduvho participated in Huawei’s Seeds for the Future (SFTF) programme. He was nominated through Univen’s partnership with Huawei to represent South Africa at the MWC. The SFTF programme’s mission is to make sure that young talents have access to the necessary skillsets and mindsets to progress in a fast-changing world. Nduvho has registered for an honours degree in the same field this year. He is also a student assistant at Univen’s ICT department. Hard work and sacrifices have clearly paid off for Nduvho. In a telephonic interview with the Limpopo Mirror, he shared his excitement over his trip abroad. “It was both satisfying and an honour to be part of the annual trade show. I had such an amazing time. We got to learn about so many exciting new technologies, a lot of them developed by Huawei. I can hardly wait to get more hands-on experience with them,” he said. He said he appreciated Univen’s leadership for having faith in him. “It is good to know that the university believed enough in me to give me the opportunity to represent South Africa, and Univen in particular,” he said. Univen’s chief financial officer, Mr Botwe Kraziya, said they were proud to be producing world-class students such as Nduvho.
