More than 2000 well-wishers and residents of the Rammbuda dynasty attended the wedding ceremony of Prince Muthuphei Chris Rammbuda at Makonde village last Saturday afternoon (4 March). The loveable prince from the clan known as “Ha Rammbuda tshiwa nga matembele, tshine tshe dzhita tsha lavhelesa bakoni la Tshavhadinda” arrived at the wedding ceremony in grand style, sandwiched between royal princes, while his gorgeous wife was escorted into a beautifully decorated wedding arena by her uncle. When pastor M.E. Maguwelele asked the two love birds to exchange their marriage vows, the prince knelt down on one knee and promised his sweetheart, Julia Sithole, that he would love her until death did them part. “When I saw you for the very first time, I knew that you were the one that I would spend the rest of my life with. I love you, babe,” he declared. When Julia responded by also declaring her undying love to him, the whole arena vibrated with ululations from the happy crowd. Pastor Maguwelele pointed out that marriage was instituted by God himself, and that the two should look upon the Lord in bad as well as good times. “Marriage is not a union of two people, but the union of two hearts. Marriage is love,” he said. The occasion was also graced by the leader of the Rammbuda dynasty, Thovhele Vho-Rammbuda, to witness the prince escorting his princess to the royal family home.
