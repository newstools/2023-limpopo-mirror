Black Leopards must collect the maximum points in their Motsepe Foundation Championship League match against Pretoria Callies, which will be played at the Malamulele Stadium on Sunday. This will be the second time that Black Leopards and Callies meet in a league clash within the space of four days. This after the two teams had tested each other’s strength in their first-round league encounter at the Lucas Moripe Stadium outside Pretoria on Wednesday afternoon. (The result of Wednesday’s match was not available at the time of our going to press). With only nine matches remaining before the end of the season, anything less than a win in their remaining fixtures will do Lidoda duvha more harm than good. The Thohoyandou side is deeply entrenched at the bottom of the log with 14 points, four behind Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila FC. The newly appointed general manager of Black Leopards, Mr Eric Muneri, said that the situation they found themselves in dictated to them that they must double their efforts in their remaining fixtures. Muneri has, however, admitted that escaping the relegation axe, though possible, would not be easy. Breaking the Leopards’ defence wall, which is marshalled by Sanele Zulu, Andiswa Ndawonde and Tshepo Matsimbi, will not be an easy task for the strikers of Callies. this fixture will be an away one for Callies, collecting the maximum points at stake will not be easy for Black Leopards. Callies had risen to the occasion and beaten Magesi FC 2-1 at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane last Saturday. Callies are also not safe regarding relegation. They are lying in the fourth position from the bottom of the log. They are tied with Venda Football Academy on 21 points. Also on Sunday, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) will take on Polokwane City at the Dr Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein. TTM are in the second-last position on the log standings with 18 points.
