Livhuwani Makungo of Makonde village, north of Thohoyandou, is a true example of how indigenous knowledge can be passed on from one generation to benefit another. Since Livhuwani can remember, her mother, Vho-Nyadzanga Makungo, has been known for making the best mabundu (traditional mageu) among the local brewers. Although the recipe is undocumented, Vho-Nyadzanga managed to pass her skills on to her daughter, who now make a living through brewing and selling mabundu along the busy Makonde/Tshilamba road. Livhuwani said that when she was born 37 years ago, her mother had already been a well-known mabundu and mafhafhe (traditional beer) brewer. “Our home was always full of people, some from afar, who came to enjoy mabundu and mahafhe. Sometimes we helped our mother with the brewing, not knowing that one day this would become a source of income.” She said that when her mother grew old, she stopped brewing mafhafhe and concentrated on mabundu only. “Age was no longer on her side, so I had to jump in because I had learnt all the tricks when we helped her at home. She could no longer carry a bucket of mabundu to the busy road because of her advanced age. Today, she smiles happily as I make the delicious mabundu under her watch. Furthermore, I don’t have to rely on someone else to survive because mabundu provides enough for us to put food on the table.” Vho-Nyadzanga said she was happy that one of her daughters was carrying on her legacy. “Most of the young people these days do not care about indigenous knowledge, but I am happy that my legacy will live on, even when I depart from this earth. There is nothing more fulfilling than seeing something you started taken over by your own child. I encourage other children to tap indigenous knowledge from their parents and guardians while they are still alive. That way, we will be able to preserve our traditions and heritage,” she said.
