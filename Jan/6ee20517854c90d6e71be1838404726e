Rumours that the senior traditional leader of Khubvi village, Vhamusanda Vho-Mmbangiseni Thinawanga Leonard Randima, had died are untrue. Randima, who is very much alive and well, said that he was shocked when he learnt about his supposed death. He believes that the people who spread these false rumours wanted to cause confusion in his peaceful village, and he warned the culprits that he would not allow them to disrupt his community. In an interview with Limpopo Mirror on Sunday (8 January), Randima said the rumours started circulating when he fell ill in December. “I fell ill – as people sometimes do - and was admitted at a private hospital where I received treatment for three weeks. Although my condition was serious, I responded well to the treatment and regained my strength. I was not aware that, while I was seriously ill, there were people out there who claimed that I had passed on.” He said family members and close relatives did not want to tell him about the rumours as they feared it could worsen his medical condition. “Everyone in the village and beyond was talking about u xa ha mativha (the passing on of a royal) and it was impossible for those close to me to hide it. I eventually learnt about it while still in hospital, but I chose to concentrate on getting well first. Life is a beautiful gift from God, and He is the only one Who has control over it. Evil people can say whatever they want, but my life is in God’s hands.” Randima said he had forgiven the rumour mongers and, as community leader, fully intended to continue focussing on the development of his community. “When I was installed as traditional leader 30 years ago, the elders told me that I will be leading different characters, but that I should accept my subjects and love them all as they are. I will continue to do good and develop this village to the best of my ability,” he concluded.
