A number of Musina residents are complaining that they have received exorbitant water bills every month since last year, and this while they hardly ever have water to begin with. Solomon Semono, a crop farmer from Matswale Extension 14, popularly known as Bra Solly, said that it amazed him how he never saw any municipal worker coming to his home to take the monthly water-meter reading, and yet he received a bill every month. “I have always paid my bills to the last cent, though I never see municipal workers take the reading. Surprisingly, they continue to bill me. I would like to know how exactly their water-billing system works,” Semono said. Nora Ndlovu from Matswale Extension 10 cannot explain her ridiculously high water bills either as she claims she seldom has running water in her taps. “I want them to explain how they come up with the amounts I am charged with. The taps are dry most of the time, but the bills become higher every month. In December, my water bill was R676,” said Ndlovu. The Vhembe District Municipality (VDM)’s spokesperson Mr Matodzi Ralushai advised Musina residents to seek clarity directly from Musina Local Municipality’s chief financial officer as the VDM and Musina Municipality had apparently signed a memorandum of understanding, making it Musina Municipality’s responsibility to bill their own clients for water.
