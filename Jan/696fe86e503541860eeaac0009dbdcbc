The chairman of Black Leopards FC, Mr David “Tshifhe” Thidiela, is optimistic that his team will make a comeback in their remaining matches and gain automatic promotion or qualify to partake in the promotional playoffs at the end of the season. During an interview with him shortly before their Nedbank Cup game against Polokwane City at the Malamulele Stadium last Saturday, Mr Thidiela said that he was convinced that he had done enough to ensure that the team gain promotion to the DStv Premiership Division come end of the season. Apart from strengthening the team’s technical department towards the end of last month, Lidoda duvha had beefed up their ailing squad by acquiring the services of a number of vastly experienced players. The Thohoyandou side had strengthened the team’s goalkeeping department by roping in Jackson Mabokwane, the former Orlando Pirates and Baroka’s number one goalkeeper. Mabokwane was part of the team’s starting 11 in their game last Saturday against Polokwane City. Although his team were beaten 0-1, Mabokwane pulled off some brilliant saves in the game. Another playmaker that was signed by Thidiela is the striker Siphelele Ntshangase. The 29-year-old goal poacher had played for Black Leopards for five soccer seasons before he left for Kaizer Chiefs. Ntshangase was not given the opportunity to display his skills last Saturday, although his name was on the list of the team’s possible substitutes. Black Leopards also added more brains to their technical staff last month. They roped in the former head coach of Venda Football Academy, Mr Johnny Ferreira, and appointed Mr Blessing Mtetwa to the position of conditioning coach. Mr Thidiela said that he had done all this simply because his aim was to see the team campaigning in the elite league come next season. He further said that he had done his homework and ensuring that his dream became a reality was now in the hands of the technical staff and the players.
