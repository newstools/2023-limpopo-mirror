The Tshilwavhusiku police are investigating the murder of a 15-year-old girl, whose body was found by passers-by in a mealie field at Tshiozwi early on Monday morning (23 January). Lungisani Phosa was a Grade 10 learner at Manaledzi High School. Provincial police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed the incident, saying that the girl might have been raped before she was stabbed to death. “She had several stab wounds to her body and died as a result of this,” he said. The police have opened cases of rape and murder. The local community members are stunned by the brutal way in which Lungisani was murdered, and parents are left frightened and concerned over the safety of their children. One of the family members, Mr Rofhiwa Phosa, said they are still trying to come to terms with Lungisani’s death. “The incident has really affected us. It will take a long time to get over this, but we put our trust in the police. We pray that the suspect will be found, even if we will never get our beloved Lungisani back,” he said. Mojapelo urged community members with information to come forward. “We are appealing to the community to cooperate with the police, so that the culprit can be arrested,” he said.
