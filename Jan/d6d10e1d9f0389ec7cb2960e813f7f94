Lutendo Faith Muthala (19) glowed with happiness when she was crowned Miss Khubvi Beauty Queen 2022. The beauty pageant was held at the Living Water Christian Church on Reconciliation Day (16 December). The beautiful lass from Tshiombo village with the lovely smile thoroughly captivated the crowd each time she walked onto the stage, but the competition was stiff as she competed against other beauties, such as Khubvi-based model Merina Nevhungoni. Muthala, who is in her final year at the University of Venda studying for a computer science degree, said she only started competing in beauty pageants early in 2022. Her first pageant was the Miss Hangwani Funerals Beauty Pageant. Unfortunately, she did not even make it to the top five. She then competed in the Miss Davhana Beauty Pageant, where she won the Miss Ambassador title. Muthala has also started her own social campaign, called Restore Your Integrity with Faith, which has already helped more than 2 000 girls around the Vhembe District from poor backgrounds with sanitary towels. “We are calling on big corporates to join hands with us in helping the thousands of poor girls out there. It is very painful to see them missing school during their menstruation periods. Together, we can make a difference in their lives,” she said.
