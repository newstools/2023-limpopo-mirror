The executive mayor of Vhembe District Municipality (VDM), Dowelani Nenguda, called the district’s top Grade 12 achievers for 2022 “shining stars” and said they were exceedingly proud of the learners’ astonishing achievements. Nenguda was speaking on Saturday, 21 January, during the Vhembe District’s farewell function for 2022’s top Grade 12 achievers who will be going to their various institutions of higher learning. The function was held in the Vhembe TVET College Hall in Makwarela. Other guests included Thulamela Mayor Sarah Rammbuda, the chairperson of the National Education Collaboration Trust (NECT) Judge Joe Raulinga and various sponsors, such as the Tshivhase Development Foundation Trust. “We want to produce professionals, like engineers, chartered accountants and land surveyors, right here in the Vhembe District, who will contribute to the development of our communities. As you are now going to institutions of higher learning, like universities and colleges, self-discipline should always guide you throughout your years of learning,” said Nenguda. He advised the 25 learners to spend their bursary funds wisely on study materials and nothing else. He said for them to learn how to manage their own budgets was important as they would not be living with their parents. Vhembe East’s director, Mr Gerson Rambiyana, was delighted with the matriculants’ good performance, saying that the good results were symbolic of the learners’ and educators’ hard work. Rambiyana said they were also very proud that the province’s top three schools, namely Mbilwi, Tshivhase and Thengwe, were all from Vhembe District. The Tshivhase Development Foundation Trust presented each of the learners with R5 000 pocket money. Vhamusanda Muelekanyi Tshivhase, who did the honours, said their great pleasure as royal leaders was to encourage and reward the learners who had worked so hard with funds to help them advance their education.
