A 42-year-old woman who is alleged to have hired criminals to kill her husband last year appeared in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday morning (18 January). Zwidofhelangani Manwadu is suspected of hiring three assassins to kill her husband, James Manwadu (46), who was an advocate attached to Legal Aid’s office in Thohoyandou. On 16 January 2022, Manwadu was allegedly about to park his car at his home when he was accosted by three men, who shot him and killed him on the spot. Tshianeo Munyai, Ndalamo Nemakhavhani and Punzo Lidzebe were arrested for Manwadu’s murder and will all appear on 2 and 3 February for bail applications. Lidzebe is also linked to the murder of Collins Chabane Mayor Moses Maluleke. Zwidofhelangani Manwadu was arrested on 17 January this year while in hiding at Tshakhuma village. Magistrate Terrence Maluleke postponed her case to 3 February to give Manwadu time to appoint her own lawyer. One of the advocates who was in court and spoke on condition of anonymity said that the deceased had been a very knowledgeable lawyer who had always assisted others. “I hope that the killers rot in jail. She robbed us and the justice system of a vital cog in the administration of justice,” he said. NPA spokesperson in Limpopo Mashudu Malabi Dzhangi said they had a watertight case and were very optimistic that all the suspects would be convicted.
