Venda Football Academy FC (VFA) have placed the head coach of the team, Mr Simo Dladla, on precautionary suspension. According to the chairman of the club, Mr Itani Munzhelele, the information was relayed to Mr Dladla shortly after the team’s 1-3 defeat to Baroka FC in their Motsepe Foundation Championship League game, played at the Global Stadium in Lebowakgomo last Saturday afternoon. Mr Dladla’s suspension follows a string of poor results by the team in their league matches. VFA had lost 0-1 to Magesi FC in their league match that was played at the Thohoyandou Stadium two weeks ago. Mr Munzhelele explained that the decision to place the former Uthongathi FC mentor on suspension was reached after they realised that accomplishing their mission as a club while Mr Dladla was still the head coach of the team was impossible. He stated that their aim was to see the team partaking in the promotional playoffs at the end of this season if they had failed to gain automatic promotion. Vhanzheli, as he is also known, has further stated that Mr Joel “The Prophet” Masutha would take over as the head coach of the team while the club dealt with Mr Dladla’s misconduct case. Mr Masutha’s first game as the head coach of the team was against MM Platinum FC, which was played at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Wednesday afternoon. The result of the match was not available at the time of our going to press. Should he finally face dismissal, Mr Dladla will be the second head coach ofVFA to be fired this season. Mr Michael Loftman, whose appointment came into effect on 1 July last year, was fired four months down the line. VFA managed to win only five of the 18 matches they have played so far. (The result of their match against MM Platinum FC, which was played at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Wednesday afternoon, not included). Their next fixture will be against Cape Town All Stars at the same venue on Saturday.
