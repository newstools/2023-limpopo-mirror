The bodies of a man and a woman were exhumed at different locations at Gogobole and Rathidili (Tshikhwani) in the Sinthumule area on Sunday, 29 January, after five members of the Western Vhukovhela security unit, who were arrested for terrorising the local communities, had allegedly confessed to killing these people and pointed out to the police the sites where they had buried their victims in shallow graves. According to police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo, the woman (33) allegedly went missing in February 2022, after she had left her home in Sekonye village in Botlokwa for Louis Trichardt. The man was reported missing in July that same year. “Investigations revealed that the woman was actually kidnapped, allegedly by the suspects, who tortured and killed her, [and] then buried her in a shallow grave. This after she allegedly refused to surrender a property in Louis Trichardt, which was initially used as a brothel,” said Mojapelo. The 40-year-old man fell victim to vigilantism when he was reportedly kidnapped from his home in Madombidzha Zone 4 after he was accused of stealing copper cables. The Vhukovhela members were arrested during a multidisciplinary, intelligence-driven operation by the Vhembe Trio Task team, the Makhado CI and the Beitbridge Task Team between 26 and 28 October last year, and were charged with kidnapping, assault and attempted murder.
