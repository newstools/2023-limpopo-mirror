Venda Football Academy (VFA) must collect at least four points in the two Motsepe Foundation Championship League matches that they will play in the next five days. Their first assignment will be to try and beat Cape Town All Stars at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. Saturday’s match will be the second for VFA in a row. VFA had played against MM Platinum FC at the same venue on Wednesday. (The result of the match was not yet available at the time of our going to press). Saturday’s game will be the second for VFA under the guidance of Mr Joel Masutha, who took over as the head coach for VFA from Mr Simo Dladla last Saturday. Mr Dladla was placed on precautionary suspension, following allegations that he had committed what the chairman of the club, Mr Itani Munzhelele, had described as “professional misconduct”. Although they will be playing in front of their home crowd, collecting the maximum points at the expense of All Stars will not be easy for VFA. The Stars are lying in the seventh position on the log standings with an outside chance to finish their league programme on top of the log. VFA will play another home match on Wednesday next week, March 1. They will host the pace setters, Casric Stars, at the same venue. The other weekend fixtures are Baroka FC vs University of Pretoria, Casric Stars vs JDR Stars, MM Platinum vs Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, Hungry Lions vs Polokwane City and Magesi FC vs Pretoria Callies. The other fixtures for next Wednesday are Pretoria Callies vs Black Leopards, Baroka vs Cape Town Spurs, Platinum City Rovers vs JDR Stars, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila vs Uthongathi FC and Magesi vs Polokwane City.
